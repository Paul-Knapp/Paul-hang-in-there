### Learning Goals:
learning goals for this project included context switching between coding languages, learning how to write good HTML and learning css comp matching. I learned how to read the mdn documentation as well as developed comfort with visual code studio keyboard shortcuts.

### Wins + Challenges:
I really enjoyed learning how to context switch even though it was a struggle early on in the project. My biggest win of the whole project was definitely writing a new function for diplaying the unmotivational posters and having it work the first time I attempted to run it.
